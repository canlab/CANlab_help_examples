The data here was provided from paingen, but we don't want references to
paingen in the filenames or code because those go into a public web page on
canlab.github.io where participants in the study might see that paingen
is a placebo study. Instead this README is here to inform future users, but
this repo is much less likely to be identified by participants than something
that's posted as a page on the web
