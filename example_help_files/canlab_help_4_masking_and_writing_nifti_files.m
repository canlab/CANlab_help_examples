%% Applying masks and writing image data to disk

% One common operation in neuroimaging is masking. Masking is defining a set
% of voxels to include or exclude from analysis or presentation. Some uses
% include:
%
% * Apply a generous brain mask to store only in-brain voxels, saving space,
%   (CANlab data objects do this by default, with a liberal mask)
% * Identify gray matter voxels to calculate global mean signal or other metrics
% * Identify voxels in ventricles or out-of-brain to try to isolate sources
%   of noise or artifacts to remove
% * Identify gray matter voxels of interest to limit the space within which
%   you correct for multiple comparisons, thus increasing power
% * Limiting presentation of results to an a priori set of ROIs
% * Limiting the scope of training or testing a multivariate pattern or
%   predictive model, to help test hypotheses about which systems/regions
%   contribute to prediction.

%% The Neuroimaging_pattern_masks Github repository and website
%
% For this walkthrough, we'll load some new image datasets to use as masks.
% A popular one is a set of "networks" developed from resting-state fMRI
% connectivity in 1,000 people. For our purposes, the "network" maps
% consist of a set of voxels that load most highly on each of 7 ICA
% components from the 1,000 Functional Connectomes project. 
% These were published by Randy Buckner's lab in 2011 in three papers:
% Choi et al., Buckner et al., and Yeo et al.  We'll use the cortical
% networks from Yeo et al. here.
%
% This set of images and other broadly useful sets of images are stored in
% the CANlab function |load_image_set| in a registry that you can access by
% name. Try |help load_image|set| for a list of images you can load by
% keyword. These datasets, if they can be stored on Github, are in this
% Github repository:
% 
% <https://github.com/canlab/Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks>
% 
% In addition, you can explore these and find more information here:
% <https://sites.google.com/dartmouth.edu/canlab-brainpatterns/home>
%
% To run this tutorial and many others in this series, you'll need to
% download the Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks Github repository and add it to
% your Matlab path with subfolders.
% The Github site has three main types of datasets, shown here:
% 
% <<Neuroimaging_pattern_masks_site.png>>
%

%% Load and select a sample mask
% You will need the Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks repository installed to find
% these images.

[bucknermaps, mapnames] = load_image_set('bucknerlab'); % loads 7 masks from Yeo et al.

%%
% This loads 7 images. try |orthviews(dat)| to see them all.
% What values do the images have?
% You can also see descriptive statistics for the images like this:

desc = descriptives(bucknermaps);

%%
% The variable |desc| is a structure that contains various descriptive
% stats.
%

%% 
% load_image_set will generally store and return names for each image,
% returned as outputs if requested (here in |mapnames|). Let's print
% those names:

disp(char(mapnames))

%%
% Now we can select one image from those 7 to use as a mask.

mask_image = bucknermaps.get_wh_image(1);

%% 
% Now we'll load a sample dataset to apply the mask to.
% This loads a series of 7 multivariate patterns from Kragel et al. 2016.
% These patterns were developed to predict emotion categories.
% For our purposes here, we'll just treat them as data images.

test_dat = load_image_set('kragelemotion', 'noverbose'); % loads 7 masks from Kragel et al.

% Try |orthviews(dat)| or use |montage| to see these patterns.
% This command shows the first 4 (a limit in |montage| to avoid messy
% displays):

montage(test_dat);

%% Apply a mask
%
% We can apply the mask using the apply_mask() method for fmri_data
% objects. It has various options, but the simplest one applies a single
% mask to an fmri_data object. As a rule, you should pass in the object you're
% operating on first, followed by additional modifying arguments/objects.
% Here, this means data object followed by mask object.

test_dat = apply_mask(test_dat, mask_image);

% Now let's view the new, masked dataset:

montage(test_dat);

% Now, the dataset contains only voxels in the "visual network", and
% subsequent analyses or operations would test only that.

%% A few exercises
%
% 1. Here's a question to answer: What are some potential uses of the masking
% operation we did above? Why would you want to do it?
%
% 2. Try loading the emotion regulation dataset from previous tutorials,
% and do a one-sample t-test group analysis only within the
% "frontoparietal" network. Try thresholding the results with FDR
% correction for both the full dataset and the analysis within the
% restricted mask. How are the results different? Why?

%% Writing image data in objects to Nifti files on disk
%
% canlabcore fmri data objects can be easily written to standard image file
% formats.  The main function for this is write()
%
% This walkthrough shows how to do this for 1) a mask image, and 2) a
% statistic image.

%% 
% Create a Nifti image called dummy.nii in the current folder. Write the
% mask image to this file. See help for write() for more options

fname = 'dummy.nii';  % outname file name.  the extension (.nii, .img) determines the format.

% |write(mask_image, 'fname', fname);| 

%%
% If you've already done this, |write()| will return an error. This is a 
% safeguard to keep users from inadvertently overwriting important files. 
% To force overwriting the existing file, try:

write(mask_image, 'fname', fname, 'overwrite');

%%
% Now let's read it back in from disk and view it again:

orthviews(fmri_data(fname))


%% Exercises
%
% 1. Select a sample image from |test_dat|, threshold it at an arbitrary threshold
%    of absolute values > .0005, and write it to disk. Load it again from
%    disk and display it. See the thresholding walkthrough for more help if
%    needed.
%
% 2. Do the one-sample t-test on the emotion regulation dataset (see the
%   t-test walkthrough if needed), and threshold the results at 0.05
%   FDR-corrected. Write the thresholded results map to disk. Reload it from
%   disk and display it using the montage() method.
