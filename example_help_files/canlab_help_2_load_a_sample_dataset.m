%% Load a sample dataset
% This example shows how to load a pre-set example fMRI dataset into
% an fmri_data object.

%% General instructions
%
% Before you start, the CANlab_Core_Tools must be added to your path with
% subfolders. Otherwise, you will get errors.
%
% The script canlab_toolbox_setup can help download and install the
% toolboxes you need.
%
% Sample datasets are in the "Sample_datasets" folder in CANlab_Core_Tools.
%
% This example will use emotion regulation data in the folder: 
% "Wager_et_al_2008_Neuron_EmotionReg"
% The dataset is a series of contrast images from N = 30 participants.
% Each image is a contrast image for [reappraise neg vs. look neg]
% 
% These data were published in:
% Wager, T. D., Davidson, M. L., Hughes, B. L., Lindquist, M. A., 
% Ochsner, K. N.. (2008). Prefrontal-subcortical pathways mediating 
% successful emotion regulation. Neuron, 59, 1037-50.

%
% Here are a couple of helpful functions we will use for display:
% (you can ignore these.)

%% Section 1: The quick and easy way to load a pre-specified dataset
%
% The function load_image_set has a number of pre-defined image sets that
% you can load with one simple command.  This is the easiest way to load
% sample data.  The images must be on your Matlab path for this to work.

[data_obj, subject_names, image_names] = load_image_set('emotionreg');

% data_obj is an fmri_data object containing all 30 images.
% subject_names is a list of short names for each image.
% image_names is a list of the full image names with their path.

%% Section 2: Manual load.  Use filenames to find file names 
%
% First, we need to list the file names in a string matrix.
% Then, we can load them into an fmri_data object
% We will use the filenames function to get the names, and the fmri_data
% object constructor function to load the data.

% First, check whether images are on your path:
% We will search for one image and save the path name.

printhdr('Check that we can find data images:')
myfile = which('con_00810001.img');
mydir = fileparts(myfile);
if isempty(mydir), disp('Uh-oh! I can''t find the data.'), else disp('Data found.'), end

% Now we can list all the file names.

printhdr('Find files and get their names:')
image_names = filenames(fullfile(mydir, 'con_008100*img'), 'absolute');
disp('Done.');

% Now load them into an fmri_data object.

printhdr('Loading the image data into the object:')
data_obj = fmri_data(image_names);

% This is the gateway to doing many other things, which are explained in
% other help files.  But just to get us started, let's run through a few
% basic things we can do. We'll mainly just look at some standard plots of
% the data.

%% Section 3: Plot the data we just loaded
%
% Operations that we can perform on fmri_data objects are called methods.
% You can see a list of methods by typing methods(data_obj).
% Here, we'll call the plot method to visualize the data.

plot(data_obj)
