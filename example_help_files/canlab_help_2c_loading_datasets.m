%% The Neuroimaging_pattern_masks Github repository and website
%
% For these walkthroughs, we'll load several image datasets.
% Some are stored in Github, if the files are small enough.
% The Wager 2008 emotion regulation dataset, for example, is
% in the CANlab Core repository. Others are on figshare or Neurovault.
%
% Many tutorials apply pre-trained patterns and masks. 
% These are stored in this Github repository:
% 
% <https://github.com/canlab/Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks>
% 
% In addition, you can explore these and find more information here:
% <https://sites.google.com/dartmouth.edu/canlab-brainpatterns/home>
%
% To run this tutorial and many others in this series, you'll need to
% download the Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks Github repository and add it to
% your Matlab path with subfolders.
% The Github site has three main types of datasets, shown here:
% 
% <<Neuroimaging_pattern_masks_site.png>>
%
%% Registries for easy loading
% There are several functions that contain sets of images that you can load
% by name. For example:
%
% |load_image_set()| includes a registry of datasets that you can access by
% name. Try |help load_image|set| for a list of images you can load by
% keyword.  
%
% |load_atlas()| also has a named set of atlases/brain parcellations you can load.
%
% |canlab_load_ROI| has a registry of many named regions derived from previous
% studies. This is particularly useful for loading a subcortical ROI and
% visualizing it or applying it to data.

%% Emotion regulation dataset
% "Wager_et_al_2008_Neuron_EmotionReg"
% The dataset is a series of contrast images from N = 30 participants.
% Each image is a contrast image for [reappraise neg vs. look neg]
% 
% These data were published in:
% Wager, T. D., Davidson, M. L., Hughes, B. L., Lindquist, M. A., 
% Ochsner, K. N.. (2008). Prefrontal-subcortical pathways mediating 
% successful emotion regulation. Neuron, 59, 1037-50.
%
% To load, try the following:

[data_obj, subject_names, image_names] = load_image_set('emotionreg', 'noverbose');

montage(mean(data_obj), 'trans', 'compact2');
drawnow, snapnow

% data_obj is an fmri_data object containing all 30 images.
% subject_names is a list of short names for each image.
% image_names is a list of the full image names with their path.

%% Buckner lab resting-state connectivity maps
%
% A popular series of masks is a set of "networks" developed from resting-state fMRI
% connectivity in 1,000 people. For our purposes, the "network" maps
% consist of a set of voxels that load most highly on each of 7 ICA
% components from the 1,000 Functional Connectomes project. 
% These were published by Randy Buckner's lab in 2011 in three papers:
% Choi et al., Buckner et al., and Yeo et al.  We'll use the cortical
% networks from Yeo et al. here.
%

[bucknermaps, mapnames] = load_image_set('bucknerlab', 'noverbose'); % loads 7 masks from Yeo et al.
disp(char(mapnames))

% Create a montage plot
o2 = montage(get_wh_image(bucknermaps, 1), 'trans', 'compact2', 'color', rand(1, 3));
for i = 2:7, o2 = addblobs(o2, region(get_wh_image(bucknermaps, i)), 'trans', 'color', rand(1, 3)); end

%% Pain, Cognition, Emotion balanced N = 270 dataset
% 
% This Dataset is from Kragel et al. 2018, Nature Neuroscience. 
% We thought it was too large for Github, and it's stored on Neurovault.org
% as collection #504. You could get it using:
%
% |[files_on_disk, url_on_neurovault, mycollection, myimages] = retrieve_neurovault_collection(504);|
%
% However, this may take a while to download, and you'd
% have to add metadata for the study category labels to use it.
% Therefore, we suggest you use the function below. It saves a file on your
% hard drive the first time you run it:
% 
% |kragel_2018_nat_neurosci_270_subjects_test_images.mat|
%
% This file also has metadata that is not necessarily on Neurovault.
% If you save this file somewhere on your Matlab path, you'll be able to
% reload and reuse the dataset easily.

[test_images, names] = load_image_set('kragel18_alldata', 'noverbose');

% This field contains a table object with metadata for each image:
metadata = test_images.metadata_table;

disp('Metadata available in test_images.metadata_table:')
metadata(1:5, :)

% Make a plot of the spatial correlation of the average image for each study

imgs = cellstr(test_images.image_names);
m = mean(test_images);

for i = 1:length(names)
    
    % Create a mean image for each study and store in "m" object.
    
    wh = metadata.Studynumber == i;
    studymean = mean(get_wh_image(test_images, find(wh)));
    m.dat(:, i) = studymean.dat;
    
end

disp('Map of spatial correlations across the mean images for each study');

%% Pain across six intensity levels per person (BMRK3)
%
% The dataset contains data from 33 participants, with brain responses to six levels
% of heat (non-painful and painful). Each image is the average over several
% (4-8) trials of heat delivered at a single stimulus intensity, ranging
% from 44.3 - 49.3 degrees C in one-degree increments. Each image is also
% paired with an average reported pain value for that set of trials, rated
% immmediately after heat experience. 
%
% This dataset is interesting for mixed-effects and predictive analyses, as
% it has both within-person and between-person sources of variance.
% 
% Aspects of this data appear in these papers:

%% CANlab 2018 Combined Atlas object
% An atlas-class object is a specialized subclass of fmri_data that stores
% information about a series of parcels, or pre-defined regions, and in
% some cases the probalistic maps that underlie the final parcellation.
%
% A list of pre-defined atlases is contained in the function |load_atlas|.
% The default atlas for some CANlab functions is the "CANlab combined 2018"
% This was created by Tor Wager from other published atlases. It includes:
%
% * Glasser 2016 Nature 180-region cortical parcellation (in MNI space, not indivdidualized)
% * Pauli 2016 PNAS basal ganglia subregions
% * Amygdala/hippocampal and basal forebrain regions from SPM Anatomy Toolbox
% * Thalamus regions from the Morel thalamus atlas
% * Subthalamus/Basal forebrain regions from Pauli "reinforcement learning" HCP atlas
% * Diedrichsen cerebellar atlas regions
% * Multiple named brainstem nuclei localized based on individual papers
% * Additional Shen atlas parcels to cover areas (esp. brainstem) not otherwise named
%
% References for the corresponding papers are stored in the atlas object, and 
% printed in tables generated with the region.table() method.
